This device generates bursts of intereference of a given type,
centered at a selected frequency, and from a programmable start to a
programmable end time.

By default the intereferer type is a WLAN (16MHz occupied) modulation, and the
burst starts in time 0 and lasts forever.

The type, center freq, and start and stop of the bursts can be controlled with
the command line parameters.
Run with --help for more information.
